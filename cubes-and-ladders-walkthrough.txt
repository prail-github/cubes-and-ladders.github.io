1.                              Introduction

===============================================================================

Cubes and Ladders was started in 2022 using Inform 7 with Vorple. 
The game begins in a long hallway at Minimax Inc., a failing electronics 
company. You guide the protaganist, Jordan Michael, through an 
office adventure where he explores the office, talks to coworkers, 
and solves puzzles. Ultimately, you must keep your job by keeping 
Minimax Inc. from bankruptcy.

There are multiple routes to solving this game. This walkthrough
presents the most direct route to a solution; not necessarily the only one.

Read this walkthrough ONLY if you get stuck as it reveals the game solution.

===============================================================================

Hallway
-------

The game starts in a long hallway. Take the leaflet and read it. 
This will give tell you the history of the company.
Go west to your cubicle and meet the boss. 
Examine the boss (who speaks in cliches) and ask her about 
Minimax and your presentation. Apparently, your presentation is not 
good enough and needs improvement by noon for an executive meeting. 
Go southeast to end your conversation. The boss will give you an evaluation
sheet and a year-end report. Go southeast to enter the cube farm, 
which is intended to be a kind of maze.

Cube Farm 5 (CF-5)
------------------
The cube farm consists of nine cube zones, CF-1 through CF-9 with nearly
identical descriptions meant to confuse. Some of the cubicles contain 
important objects you must collect. From CF-5 you go northeast to 
CF-4 where you meet the security guard who blocks you path to the south.

CF-4
----
Examine the guard and ask him about intuders and cubes. 
To get past the security guard and head south you must show him your year-end
report. This bores him to sleep and you can then pass. You can also ask him
questions for a few turns before he falls asleep. Take the flashlight. 
Go north to CF-2.

CF-2
----
Nothing of interest. Go west to CF-1.

CF-1
----
Take the Buddha poster, which hides the silver key. Go east to CF-2, then
east to CF-3.

CF-3
----
Take the Minimax branded mug which hides the bronze key. Go west to CF-2, 
south to CF-4 (and the sleeping guard), then south to CF-6.

CF-6
----
Nothing of interest. Go east to CF-7 where you see a Storage Door.

CF-7
----
Unlock the storage door with the bronze key. Open the door and go south into
the storage room.

Storage Room
------------
Examine the plaque to learn about the Complexifier. Examine the copier.
Switch on the copier. Put the year-end report in the copier to produce
a complex report. This report will appease your boss who wasn't pleased 
with your earlier work on the year-end report. Take the complex report and
go north to CF-7, west to CF-6, north to CF-4, north to CF-2, and east to
CF-3.

CF-3
----
Nothing of interest. Proceed southeast to CF-8 where you see the door
to the Marketing Storage Room.

CF-8
----
Unlock the door with the silver key. Open the door and head east into
The Marketing Storage Room.

Marketing Storage
-----------------
In this room you must get the cap that is out of your reach. Drop the 
complex report. Stand on complex report and take the cap. Go west to CF-8,
Go northwest to CF-3, west to CF-2, and north to the breakroom.

Break Room
----------
In the breakroom you meet Rich, the salesman who is interested in merch
and donuts. You can ask Rich about different topics like the company, 
marketing, and rumors. You cannot get a donut unless you distract Rich, 
so give Rich the cap. Once he leaves, open the pastry box and take 
the donut for later.
Go east to the Gallery.

Gallery
-------
The gallery contains a portrait that contains clues to help solve puzzles.
Examine the portrait, the founder, the calculator and the bust of 
Marcus Aurelius. Write down the description of the bust for later. 
Go northeast to the Chairman's office.

Chairman's Office
-----------------
In the Chairman's office you meet Max Jr. the somewhat reluctant leader
of Minimax Inc. Examine Max. You can ask him questions about Minimax and his
father. Take the newspaper and head southwest back to the Gallery and 
then east to the conference room where your boss awaits you.

Conference Room
---------------
Give the complex report to the boss. This appeases her, and she quickly
dismisses you and you end up in the Gallery holding a layoff memo.
When you read the memo you learn the layoff rumors were true. 
Go west to the breakroom, north to the hallway, and then east to the Helpdesk.

Helpdesk
--------
At the helpdesk you find Ray the techie. You can examine Ray and ask him about
Minimax and the research lab. He will not help you unless you give him the donut. 
Once you give him the donut he will open a trapdoor to a tunnel and leave. Enter the 
tunnel by going down.

Damp Tunnel
-----------
Switch on the flashlight. If you examine the black panel you will realize
it can be opened by typing something on the calculator keypad. Type the 
combination you learned from the bust in the form 999-999 into the keypad
(type 999-999 on keypad) to open the panel and reveal the secret research lab.
Note that if your flashlight runs out of power it will be useless. 
You can retrieve a more reliable light source from the conference room
after the executive meeting is over at 12:30pm. 

Research Lab
------------
You are in Max Prophet's legendary research lab. In the lab you must complete
an important invention to save your job and the company. Examine the workbench.
There you will find a notebook, a screwdriver, and a Tic-Tac-Toe machine. 
Examine the magazine clipping to learn about the Tic-Tac-Toe machine. Take
the screwdriver. Examine the notebook to reveal what invention you are 
to complete from the parts before you. You need to salvage a part from the 
Complexifier so return there by typing "walk to storage room"

Storage Room (again)
--------------------
The complexifier has a maintenance compartment that contains a part we need.
If you try to open the compartment, you will be reminded it is shut tight
with rusty screws. To unlock the compartment we use the screwdriver. Type
"loosen screws" then examine the compartment's contents and take the
neuropack, which is the brain of the complexifier. We need this brain to 
complete the invention in the research lab. Next, type "walk to research lab" 

Research Lab (again)
-------------------
Connect the fax machine to the Tic-Tac-Toe machine. Turn on fax.
Examine the Tic-Tac-Toe machine and notice it has an expansion port.
This is where you place the neuropack to complete the invention. Because
the Predict-Tac-Toe machine needs input you next put the newspaper in the
fax machine which will send information to the invention. A projection report
appears that predicts future business news, including stock prices. This 
breakthrough will save the company. To complete the game, examine the 
projection report or show it to Junior. You find your self in the Corner Office.

Corner Office
-------------
Your reward for saving Minimax Inc. from failure is a promotion and a nice
corner office overlooking a scenic golf course.

3.                              Game Trivia

===============================================================================

1. You can open the maintenance compartment on the Complexifier with the impact 
screwdriver or the laser pointer.

2. There are two ways to die. You can stand on the office chair in the marketing 
storage room or you can try touching the frayed cable in the damp tunnel. 
This may have been how Max Prophet Sr. ended his earthly career.

3. Max Prophet Sr. was based on a real person--a finalist in the Westinghouse 
Science Talent search of 1950 who built a Tic-Tac-Toe machine as described in 
the magazine clipping.  Here a museum curator talks 
about him https://youtu.be/4sDYK4hDwAM?t=601
