A surprising paragraph from next week's front page is also included:[paragraph break][italic type]Minimax Inc. scores a major victory by announcing a groundbreaking stock-picker technology. This news represents a new lease on life for Minimax Inc., which has struggled in recent years due to increased overseas competition and shrinking demand for office machines.

Curiosity tugs at you. Through a film of grime on the screen, a ghostly image flickers--the indistinct outline of an old man's face, his lips moving in silent conversation.[paragraph break]A tremor of unease runs down your spine, yet your feet seem to propel you closer, drawn by the enigmatic figure behind the dusty glass.[paragraph break]Through a crackle of static, you hear a faint voice, and then... a face fully materializes on the screen. It's Max Prophet, the company founder, a man you've only seen in faded photographs. The same flat-top haircut and bushy white eyebrows, the same stern expression, but somehow... fainter. Translucent. He is a spectral Max, a Max filtered through a cobwebbed screen.[paragraph break]Max blinks, his ghostly eyes adjusting to the harsh light, and says in a raspy voice, 'Took you long enough. I've been sleeping down here for a long while and no one bothered to check the lab?'[paragraph break]'Wait a minute. Now I remember the power surge. That was a doozy. Well, given my love of electronics, I guess it's fitting that I end up here, just a latent signal in a set of old vacuum tubes.'[paragraph break]He continues, 'Thanks for the wake-up call, though.
